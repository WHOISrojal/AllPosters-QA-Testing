# Testing for the allposters.com website is going on as login, search, addtocart are tested with some invalid login cases, search cases, and logout cases
# ðŸ§ª Playwright Test Automation â€“ Login Test

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing. The focus is on automating the **login functionality**, located under the `TestCaseProject/TestCase/login` directory.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system.

### 1. Install project dependencies
```
npm install
```

### 2. Install Playwright and required browsers
```
npx playwright install
```

### 3. Navigate to the test folder, run:
```
cd TestCaseProject
cd TestCase
cd login
```

### ðŸš€ Running Tests
ðŸ”¹ Headless Mode (runs in background)
This runs the test without opening the browser:
```
npx playwright test login.spec.js
```

ðŸ”¹ Headed Mode (opens browser window)
This runs the test with the browser UI visible, great for debugging:
```
npx playwright test --headed login.spec.js
```
